"Learning"

I had the program doing certain commands and exercises that reflect the fact that I was listening to the lecture yesterday evening from
Mr. Black. Yesterday we learned that we can make the program say certain things in the console box and we even learned that the console
can function as a calculator and calculate certain problems that makes the programers life much easier.
